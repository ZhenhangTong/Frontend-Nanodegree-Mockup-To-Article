Your response goes here!
1)I understand more about html, css and javascript, like data structure. Further more, the difference between <b> and <strong>, which some people don’t pay attention to. I believe my colleagues couldn’t tell the difference between them. :)
2)So far everything goes well, for I’m a PHP engineer and I’m already familiar with HTML, CSS and Javascript. So it’s not difficult for me to keep up.
3)Writing Javascript. It’s nearly completely new to me, for last time I wrote Javascript is like two years ago. I forgot it totally.
4)Most of times, I googled it.
